# Ad hoc curriculum on COVID-19 and "outbreak science"
(work in progress)

#### We will keep substantial parts of the original curriculum (see [README](../README.md)), and extend those components that relates to "outbreak science", e.g. _the concept of modeling_, _diffusion_, _tracer kinetics_, _network science & graph theory_, ..., every topic supported by Jupyter notebooks (see below) - with programming exercises and challenges (see below)

### Reading material
  #### Book chapters
   - Selected chapters from Domingo WE. _Virus as Populations Composition, Complexity, Dynamics, and Biological Implications_. Academic Press, 2016. [[link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128008379/virus-as-populations)]
  #### Papers
  
  #### Data and challenges
   - **Fighting Covid-19 Challenge** Medical imaging is potentially well suited for Covid-19 diagnosis. "This challenge is about connecting the best brains to support doctors with artificial intelligence systems" (https://www.covid19challenge.eu)

## Online slides (some with video)
