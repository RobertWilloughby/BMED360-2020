# Ad hoc curriculum on COVID-19 and "outbreak science"
(work in progress)

#### We will keep substantial parts of the original curriculum (see [README](../README.md)), and extend those components that relates to "outbreak science", e.g. _the concept of modeling_, _diffusion_, _tracer kinetics_, _network science & graph theory_, ..., every topic supported by Jupyter notebooks (see below) - with programming exercises and challenges (see below)
