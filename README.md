# In Vivo Imaging and Physiological Modelling - BMED 360 Spring 2020

## ( with [_ad hoc_](./outbreak-science/README_outbr_sci.md) curriculum* on COVID-19 and "outbreak science" )

![BMED360 image](./assets/bmed360_logo.png)

This is the repository for the course [BMED360](https://www.uib.no/en/course/BMED360) given at the Department of Biomedicine<br>

Biomedicine covers those areas of human biology, chemistry and medicine that seek to explain the factors behind health and disease at the molecular and cellular level. This information is applied in the development of better diagnostics and treatments.<br>

In this repository you find presentations, documentation, code, and partly data for the course.

The goal of this course is to obtain theoretical and practical knowledge on functional and quantitative in vivo imaging in man and animal using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer-based image analysis. The focus is on brain imaging (perfusion, diffusion, permeability mapping) and structural and functional connectivity, but also examples from functional kidney imaging and (image-based) systems biology will be presented. A major objective is also to give insight about the importance of mathematical models and computations in analysis and understanding of complex physiological processes, and the need of cross-disciplinary collaborations.



***) <br>We plan to run BMED 360 (8 students enrolled) starting April 21 ("fully digitized") with a slightly modified curriculum, also addressing COVID-19 and "outbreak science" from a computional imaging and modeling perspective. There will be online slides, computer labs (code and data on GitHub,  using issue tracker for student interaction), assignments/challenges, digital MCQ, and a final digital oral exam from home (presenting yor personal project on Google hangouts / Zoom / Skype - taking load from MittUiB, mostly used for static information). Grading has been A-F, this semester we will use pass/nopass. <br>This is work in PROGRESS . . .**



You will find more (static) information about
this course at [MittUiB](http://mitt.uib.no/course/17428).




# Setting up your system (preparation to the course)

**Follow the instructions at [Setting up your system](setup.md) (`setup.md`) to get ready**



# Notebooks
The course is based on the Jupyter Notebook, a web-based framework for developing and presenting code-based projects (take a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk og https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for introductions to Jupyter Notebooks).

Throughout the course you will work with notebooks that contain various material and programming tasks. We recommend that you *make a copy of our notebooks before you are editing them*. In this respect you might adopt the naming convention `my_[name_of_notebook].ipynb`.


## Get started - test your environment
* [Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Nibabel, Biopython and more](notebooks/0.0-test.ipynb): run through this notebook (`test-notebooks/0.0-test.ipynb`) to check that your environment is OK.<br>
